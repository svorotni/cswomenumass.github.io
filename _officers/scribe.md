I am a third year MS/PhD student working with Andrew McGregor in the Theory research group. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from UMass Amherst in 2014.

My research interests lie in the area of design and analysis of algorithms. In particular, I am interested in processing massive graphs in small amount of time and using limited resources. Other topics I explore include graph theory, information theory, and communication complexity. For more information, go to my [website](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~svorotni/).
